# PixivImageViewer

PixivImageViewer is  my hobby project, a light web application built with Fastify, JavaScript and Pug using [@book000/pixivts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@book000/pixivts) with some modifications. It provides a front-end gallery for users to browse the illustrations on Pixiv.

**Notice: This app only provides a lightweight image frontend, allowing users to find and access their desired illustrations. It does not include a download option and will only display the medium-sized version of the first illustration if there are multiple illustrations, along with a link to the original illustration on Pixiv.
**Note:** Due to Pixiv's restrictions on using direct image links, this app will download the images to the `image/` folder inside the project directory.**

**Note:** **This app web is intended for personal use and research purposes only. It is not an official app or affiliated with Pixiv in any way**
